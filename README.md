Project Title: Hangman Puzzle Game

The game is based in the movie matrix. In it's main page, the user can choose between single or multiplayer activity.

In the singleplayer activity, a random word is picked from the arrays.xml file, and the user has to guess the right letters of the word selected.
If the user guess it right, the letter is displayed in a textview. When all the letters of the word are visible, an alert dialog let the user 
knows, they won. If the user makes a wrong guess, part of the image assets are displayed in the screen. When the 7th wrong guess is made an
alert dialog tells the user that the game is over.

For the multiplayer, some of the code from the singleplayer activity got repurposed. Here, the user has the opportunity to challenge somebody 
else by entering a word. The second player would be able to guess it and the code goes back to the same mechanics applied to the singleplayer
activity, where if the user guess it right, the letter is displayed in a textview. When all the letters of the word are visible, an alert dialog let the user 
knows, they won. If the user makes a wrong guess, part of the image assets are displayed in the screen. When the 7th wrong guess is made an
alert dialog tells the user that the game is over.
